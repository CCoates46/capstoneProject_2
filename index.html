            <p>Hi! I'm Clare,  I'm a mum to 2 small humans and I live in Leicestershire.</p>
            <p>I am currently a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) for Dunelm and I am making the move into Software Development 
                and Web Design and Development.</p>
            <p>My background: I spent 10 years in the banking industry across various business areas, I was a qualified mortgage advisor 
                and mortgage underwriter. Then I fell into the role of a software tester. I spent 14 years as a manual 
                software tester across different domains.</p>
            <p>Two years ago I started at Dunelm and I was inspired by the way that they approached Quality so I began
                to self study coding at home, whilst holding down a full time job and mum to 2 small humans. 
                I studied a full Javascript bootcamp course via Udemy. 
                I began to write code in my day to day job and I impressed management so I was then promoted to the SDET role back in January.</p>
            <p>Now I am studying a Full Stack Web Development course again via Udemy as I would now like to switch roles into becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer. </p>
            <p>I also love to code outside of work for fun and enjoy pair programming with friends learning different things.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding I love singing, especially at Karaoke's. I also enjoy walking my  2 dogs: a 2 year old labrador called Arthur and a 1 year old mini dachshund called Fred.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy baking with my 2 girls and watching them swimming.</p>
